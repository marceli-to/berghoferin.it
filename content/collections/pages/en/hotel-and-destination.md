                text: 'A gem of a hotel with just 13 suites and the charm of a meticulously curated private estate. Picturesquely located at 1,500 m above sea level, nestled in a wonderfully hilly and mountainous landscape carpeted in forests and lush meadows in the foothills of the dissimilar twin peaks of Corno Bianco and Corno Nero, facing south with a full view of the stunning mountain panorama, far from noisy, hectic city life.'

                text: 'The Fine Hotel & Hideaway Berghoferin is an aesthetically pleasing high-quality retreat for guests. It was remodelled with a strong focus on integrating it into the surrounding countryside and aligning it with the regionâ€™s history and values while also enhancing it with some very special highlights. It considers itself to be a place of savoir-vivre that promises enjoyment in a sophisticated, culture-savvy atmosphere as well as a refuge for guests seeking to find calm and slow down the pace of everyday life for a while in the surrounding nature and the many possibilities it has to offer. Berghoferin is both a Fine Hotel & Hideaway.'
