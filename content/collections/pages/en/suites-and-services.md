                text: 'Thirteen generously sized and light-infused suites, each with its own interior design, spread out across three floors. Loft-like studios with a combined living and sleeping area or classic suite floor plans with a separate bed- and living room, many with two bathrooms, all with a sunlit patio and one or two loggia balconies that grant privacy while affording a most impressive full view—of the sweeping expanse of a pristine, natural landscape; of a majestic mountain panorama that stretches along the horizon behind seemingly endless green forests; of the deep valley below that opens up as a gateway to the south off in the distance; of the local mountains and their prominent black-and-white peaks that pierce the blue sky above.'

                text: 'True to our unique style, the thirteen suites here at the Fine Hotel & Hideaway Berghoferin serve as thirteen special guest retreats, each with a different size and location, individual room layout, and its own design and furnishings to satisfy a wide range of personal needs and wishes. We warmly welcome our guests to stay with us and experience this intimate ambience and enjoy our customised services. From the early morning hours while the world is still in slumber, when the fragrant mountain air wafts in through the open window to gently wake you, to the late evening when the calming sounds of nature envelop you beneath the silver moonlight: in these comfortable surroundings you will feel at ease and know you are in good hands, in a place to which you have perhaps never been before—and to which you might wish to return (time and again) for that very reason.'
