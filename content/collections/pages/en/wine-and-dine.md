In a refined and elegant atmosphere, the restaurant serves dinner (and lunch as well on weekends) with a strong commitment to raising awareness about the products and optimum processing methods. The dishes prepared in our kitchen are mostly seasonal and regionally sourced, freshly made, locally inspired, and innovatively adapted. A comprehensive wine list and, upon request, a wine pairing selected to match your personal taste, highly discreet and attentive waiting staff, and the special atmosphere of the different restaurant areas available to our guests—from the dining hall, patio, and terrace to the Gothic parlour—complete the culinary fine-dining experience at the Saligen.'
